iParkMe
=======

A simple webapp which saves your current location to help you find your car later.

This was a webapp I made in the the month of July in 2014. It was simple, but useful for me as I seem to lose where my car is quite often. Using this app you can save your cars location when you park and then see a map of where it is.

This project utilizes the Google Maps API, cookies, and HTML5 local storage.

A current version of the app is hosted via Google App Engine at http://amcolash-iparkme.appspot.com
